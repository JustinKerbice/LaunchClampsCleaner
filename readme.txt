Launch Clamps Cleaner 1.0


1. About

Have you even been tired by having to remove all the launch clamps used one by one in the tracking station ?
Even worth, if you use Kerbtown base building launch site, and forgot to do the clean-up yourself, you may see launch clamps surrounding by previous launch clamps some lazy kerbals left there.

Now, with Launch Clamps Cleaner, no need to get your hands dirty by doing the job yourself, these damned clamps will be destroyed upon use.


2. Requirements

KSP 0.24.2, not tested on other releases but they should work on next releases.


3. how to install it ?

Simply merge the provided GameData folder into your own.


4. how to remove it ?

Simply delete the folder Kerbice Group\ from you <KSP dir>\GameData directory.


5. usage

Create something, add launch clamps to it (if relevant), launch. When you are at some distance from launch clamps (~ 600m) they just explode, freeing launch site for another launch. You don't have to do anything special.


6. Career mode/recovery

For now, in this 1.0 release, launch clamps just explode, so you loose their cost. Auto-recovery will be added later.


7. know issues

none.


A. modinfo file ?

This is just an experimental file which can be used by as much modders as possible to help writing mod tools to get some key info to manage them.
Kind of Debian package thing for people who know it.

1.0  /09/2014 initial release
